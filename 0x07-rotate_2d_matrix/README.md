By understanding these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be able to approach the problem methodically, first transposing the matrix and then reversing each row to achieve a 90-degree clockwise rotation. This project not only tests your ability to manipulate 2D matrices but also challenges you to think about optimizing your solution to operate in-place, thus improving their problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills in Python.
